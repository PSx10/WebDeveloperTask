Images have been done with 2 approaches so I could play with them a little.

Clone the repo or do it by .zip file
    - git clone https://github.com/PSx10/WebDeveloperTask.git

SETUP

1. Install node.js

    https://nodejs.org

2. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

    - npm install
    - npm run dev
    - npm run watch:scss - just scss
    - npm run watch:ts - just typescript
    - npm run PSx10 - both scss and ts
